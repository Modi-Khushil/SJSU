# Github Co-Pilot:
Two tasks are done using the Github co-pilot tool. This tool is so awesome and cool that you don't need to code in the first place. You can simply write comments that what you're trying to write the logic for and this tool would suggest you the entire snipets of that code. It's a smart autocomplete for coding.
Used Virtual Studio Code and set up the environment in that.
### Task 1 
A Keras Based Neural Network for MNIST dataset model traing and prediction.
<br>
### Task 2
A PyTorch based NN for BertTokenizer using toxic comments dataset.
